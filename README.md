recipes
=======

This repository hosts clld recipes, i.e. gist-like code snippets and scripts which are useful in the 
context of clld apps, e.g. to manage the database, or do other out-of-band tasks.

One particular criterion in deciding whether a script should go here or into an app's `scripts` directory are 
non-standard requirements, e.g. PyX. When non-standard packages are required, a script should contain an explanation
and be placed here.
